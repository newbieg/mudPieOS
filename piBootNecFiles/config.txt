## This config.txt file is going to be built from scratch, I'm not going to enable everything just for the sake of having it enabled. 
## I'll only be enabling things as they catch my attention, or as a tutorial describes

## Set HDMI safe Mode for good compatibility options
hdmi_safe=1

## Load kernel to address 0? (https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/docs/lesson01/rpi-os.md)
## Not how the OSDev Wiki handles it, but may be a good option to avoid complications later on...
#kernel_old=1
